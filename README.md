# taskel
#### A Python Terminal User Interface for simplifying tasks in RHEL 8. This project is my practical implementation of things I learned in RHEL (IIEC RISE). ðŸ¤ 

## Work done till now:

1) I've written the basic functionalities for the program. ðŸ¤“
2) This can establish connection to localhost or a remote PC too! ðŸ¤©
3) I've also made a comfertable menu based UI for navigation and operation. One handy function to manage menu layouts! ðŸ“¡
4) Also, for starters I've added few basic operations in 'run()' method too! This makes it easier to add more functionalities as we just have to add the OS command in this method. ðŸ˜Œ

## What's comming next?
- I am learning more about Linux, Python, networking and other cool computer stuffs. So I will be adding more to this initial project. There's no limit to what one can create with regular learning. ðŸ˜‡

## Want to share something cool you know?
- I would super happy if you feel to share your knowledge and contribute to this small project of mine! ðŸ˜„
- Add your cool stuff to 'develop' branch of the repository or raise any issues in issue section, I'll resopnd asap. ðŸ’»
- Also, Thank you for visiting. ðŸ¤—
